# Little Lemon Restaurant Website

The aim of the project is to build a fully functional website frontend for the restaurant, Little Lemon, including at least a landing page and a table reservation page, using basic and advanced React principles. It is also important to take note of the responsiveness and performance of the website. This project is the final assignment for <b>Meta Front-end Developer Capstone Project course</b>, provided via Coursera.

### Challenges Faced

The API link provided by Meta to populate the available time slots in reservation page was somehow broken. This issue had to be fixed by somewhat mocking the API action in the project itself.

## Further Development

### Enhancement Opportunities

I am looking forward to enhance the `Menu` section as well as building the `Order Online` & `Login` section. In future, I look forward to develop this into a full-fledged Full Stack Website.

### Acknowledgment

I would like to thank my fellow learners in the Meta course, who posted numerous solutions in the discussion forums to overcome various kinds of difficulties encountered throughout the project - especially in case of the broken API link.
